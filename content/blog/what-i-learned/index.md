description: An article explaining the purpose of this blog
---

I have come to the realization that one of the best ways for a person to solidify their own knowledge in a subject or craft is to share that knowledge amongst his friends, colleagues and curious strangers.

It is a bit ironic and poetic that one of the secrets to growth for any individual is for that individual to share his own strength

Hence, this blog site.

The desire to improve my own skills and knowledge has led me to the conclusion that I should let others benefit from the little that I know so that I myself may consolidate the strength it has to offer.

Therefore, ironically, I might only be doing this for selfish reasons.
