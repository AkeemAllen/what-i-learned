# What I Learned Archives

This is a passion project meant to improve my own skill with regard to frontend development and api development. Specificially graphql.

## Frontend

This project utilizes ReactJs. More specificially, a personally modified version of the gatsbyjs starter blog.

## Backend

This project uses the popular headless CMS known as contentful in order to host the blogs. They also provide a proprietary graphql API that is used within the application to fetch the blog posts.
